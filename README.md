Continuous integration (CI) using AWS Cloud9 for development, GitHub for version control, and GitHub Actions for automated CI.

Steps followed:

1) Set up a AWS Cloud9 environment and create an EC2 instance
2) Create a GitHub repo, in this case, CI-CD-with-Cloud
3) Setup a SSH connection between Cloud9 and GitHub
4) Create a simple python project in Cloud9 and push it to GitHub
5) Create a workflow using GitHub Actions to automate the build process whenever a change is pushed
6) Test the workflow by making a minor change and pushing it to the repo from Cloud9
